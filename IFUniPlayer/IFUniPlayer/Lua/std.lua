 *   performed at startup regardless of how we're starting.

 *   in "adv.t".

 *   during the game by calling parserSetMe(newMe).  You can also create
 *   additional player character objects, if you want to let the player
 *   take the role of different characters in the course of the game, by
 *   creating additional objects that inherit from basicMe.  (Inheriting
 *   from basicMe isn't required for player character objects -- you can
 *   define your own objects from scratch -- but it makes it a lot easier,
 *   since basicMe has a lot of code pre-defined for you.)
